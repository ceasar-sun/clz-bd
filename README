Goal:
* Deploy CDH Hadoop environment automatically especially for massive deployment usage.
* Optional:
	Clonezilla SE Deplloyment: By Clonezilla postrun, user just need to prepare a native Linux OS Cloneizlla image. 

Require:
* Machines' mac adddress list (option): If SE assign IP by mac address, list can auto-generate form dhcpd.conf. If not, user have to prepare macs list of all machines
* Optional:
	Clonezilla SE Deplloyment:
	* Clonezilla : SE or Live edition. To save then deploy Linux image via Clonezilla

Support:
* Linux OS version: Debian, Ubuntut, LinuxMint , with LVM2
* Hadoop version : CDH (Cloudera's Distribution Hadoop)

How to use :
1) Normal :

Step 1: Prepare
1.1. Prepare a supported native OS and download clz-bd project,
https://github.com/ceasar-sun/clz-bd/releases/latest
1.2. Execute setup with root privilege and follow the indication  
$ sudo ./clz-bd/setup

Step 2: Deploy
2.1. Use disk clone tool(ex: Cloenzilla, Ghost, TrueImage) to deploy the system image that be prepared in step 1 to expected machines.

Step 3: Test Hadoop environment
3.1. Until all clients reboot then run native OS, the necessary services would be started in master node automatically.
3.2. Login to master node and run Hadoop test code via 'hduser' account :
$ hadoop jar /opt/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.0-cdh5.3.1.jar pi 4 100000

2) Optional : Clonezilla SE (Please skip this if you don't deploy image via Clonezilla postrun)

Step 1: Prepare
1.1. Make sure a saved image is ready and download Clonezilla-BD module:
$ git clone https://github.com/cesaar-sun/clz-bd.git
1.2. Check and prepare necessary config files and CDH package, network connection is required. At last step, it would install itself as a postrun module in Clonezilla SE environment if available (root privilege required )
$ cd clz-bd; ./deploy-bd.sh --parpare

Step 2: Set postrun and deploy
2.1. Run dcs command to setup ocs restore procedure , check postrun parameter "-o1" in expert mode
2.2. Make clients machine to run ocs restore procedure , then CDH environment would be deploy during ocs-postrun stage

Step 3: Test Hadoop environment
3.1. Until all clients reboot then run native OS, the necessary services would be started in master node automatically.
3.2. Login to master node and run Hadoop test code via 'hduser' account :
$ hadoop jar /opt/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.0-cdh5.3.1.jar pi 4 100000
