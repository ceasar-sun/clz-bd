How to use :

* Prepare : 
Check and prepare necessary config files and CDH package, network connection is required. At last step, it would install itself as a postrun module in Clonezilla SE environment if available (root privilege required )

$ deploy-bd.sh --parpare

* Set postrun and deploy
1. Run dcs command to setup ocs restore procedure , select Postrun parameter "-o1" in advanced mode
2. Make clients machine to run ocs restore procedure , then CDH environment would be deploy during ocs-postrun stage

* Test Hadoop environment
1. Until all clients machine reboot then runnig native OS, the necessary services would be started in master node automatically.
2. Usually, master node booting would take time to wait all slave nodes on line (stay in rc.local service) for starting relative services
3. Login to master node and run Hadoop test code via 'hduser' account :
$ hadoop jar /opt/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.0-cdh5.3.1.jar pi 4 100000
